"""All the command functions should be implemented here.
Feed-forward functions are called on Request objects and must return a pair
containing a string SQL query and a tuple of arguments to place into the query.
Feedback functions are called on the results of a query, and should return a
string message detailing the success/failure of the command.
By convention, corresponding feed-forward and feedback functions should have
the same base name, prefixed with ff_ and fb_ respectively.
These functions are stored in the dispatch_fns dictionary using the command
name as the key and the pair of feed-forward and feedback functions as the
value.
Database table-names are as follows:
reminders     - Reminders to be issued at a certain time.
notifications - Notifications to be issued when a user is next seen online.
